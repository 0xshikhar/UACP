Here’s a detailed summary of the architecture, structure, and key implementation patterns found in the a2a-x402-typescript repository, which you can use directly or adapt for your Somnia SDK and agent workflows:

https://github.com/dabit3/a2a-x402-typescript ( see a2a-x402-typescript folder)

Project Structure
x402_a2a/: Main library with TypeScript implementation of the A2A protocol plus X402 payment extensions.
client-agent/: Example agent acting as a payment-enabled client (consumer/orchestrator).
merchant-agent/: Example service provider agent, requesting and processing payments.
README.md: Rich documentation and standard usage flows.
Key Components & Classes
1. x402_a2a Library
This package is the heart of A2A + X402, providing:

x402PaymentRequiredException: Exception you throw in your agent code (service side) to signal that a payment is required for the requested resource/action. You specify all payment requirements here (scheme, network, asset, payTo, amounts, description, etc.)

processPayment(): Client-side helper that signs and constructs a payment payload from the requirements, using an ethers.js Wallet.

x402Utils: Utility class for:

Parsing and extracting payment status and requirements from agent tasks/messages
Recording successful payment events
x402ServerExecutor (abstract): Base class for merchant/service provider agents. Methods you’d override/implement:

verifyPayment(payload, requirements): Logic for payment verification
settlePayment(payload, requirements): Final settlement/on-chain call
x402ClientExecutor (abstract): Base for wallet/payment client agents. Handle:

handlePaymentRequired(error, task): What to do when payment is required
How It Works (Flow)
Merchant (Agent/Service) Side
Request Payment:
Your agent (API, Node.js controller, etc.) throws x402PaymentRequiredException describing the required payment.

throw new x402PaymentRequiredException(
  "Payment for banana",
  {
    scheme: "exact",
    network: "base-sepolia",
    asset: "0xTOKEN", // USDC, etc
    payTo: "0xYourWallet",
    maxAmountRequired: "1000000", // (in wei)
    resource: "/buy-product",
    description: "Purchase banana",
    mimeType: "application/json",
    maxTimeoutSeconds: 1200,
  }
);
Respond with HTTP 402:
Standard for X402 – receives a Payment Required HTTP code and payment instructions.

Client (Orchestrator/User Agent) Side
Parse Payment Requirements:
Use x402Utils.getPaymentRequirements(task) to extract payment info from the task/request.

Sign/Process Payment:
Use processPayment(requirements, wallet) to produce a signed payload (using ethers.js wallet).

const paymentPayload = await processPayment(requirements, wallet);
This is attached to the follow-up HTTP request, typically in a custom header (X-PAYMENT).

Verify and Settle:
Merchant/server uses verifyPayment() and settlePayment() for their part.

Example Agents Included
client-agent: Works as a payment-enabled orchestrator; can process user purchase flows, sign off on payments, and demonstrates end-to-end experience.
merchant-agent: Requests, verifies, and settles crypto payments (dynamic pricing, order fulfillment, settlement).
Supported Features
Exception-driven, dynamic payment flows
Full EVM network and ERC-20 support
TypeScript interfaces and types
Test/development scripts for all core scenarios
Summary for Somnia UACP SDK Integration
You can directly use or adapt the x402_a2a library inside the SDK, especially for all payment-required scenarios.
Use the pattern of merchant and client agents in your own SDK examples and codegen/templates.
The exception-driven approach for payments slots in smoothly with A2A agent-to-agent request/response cycles.
For detailed implementation, you can walk through their base classes, abstract executors, and utility flows—these will anchor your payment extension logic and keep you in line with best practices for both agent comms and payments.
